# 1Inflated_surv

This repository contains the R code and presentation for an 1-inflated parametric survival model that I created.  
The application of this model is for pharmaceutical medication length of therapy.

The presentation contains motivation of the work.
Unforunately, the data used for the analysis in the presentation cannot be made available.
The R code thus simulates from the model and proceeds to estimate the parameters and creates the graphs.   
Users are welcome to take the code and modify for your own use.  
Please cite this repository when appropriate.  Thank you.


I presented this work with my coworker Srihari in the Annual PMSA confererence 2022.
I will present it again in the Annual INFORMS meeting 2022.
