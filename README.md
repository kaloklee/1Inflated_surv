# One-inflated Survival Model

This repository contains the R code and presentation for an one-inflated parametric survival model that I created.  
My application of this model is for pharmaceutical medication length of therapy.  The presentation contains motivation of the work.
I would love to hear the use of this model in other applications and industries.  

The data used for the analysis in the presentation unforunately cannot be made available.

The R code thus simulates from the model, proceeds to estimate the parameters and creates the graph.   

Users are welcome to take the code and modify for your own use.  
Please cite this repository when appropriate.  Thank you.


I presented this work with my coworker Srihari Jaganathan in the Annual PMSA confererence 2022.
I will present it again in the Annual INFORMS meeting 2022.
