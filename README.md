# One-inflated Survival Model

This repository contains the R code and presentation for an one-inflated parametric survival model that I created.  

My application of this model is in pharmaceutical medication length of therapy. The presentation has the motivation of the work.
I would love to hear from you the use of this model in other applications and industries.  

The presentation uses animated slides. Please view it in slide show mode.
The data used for the analysis in the presentation unforunately cannot be made available.

I share 2 R codes.  Both simulate the data, proceeds to estimate the model and creates the graph. One R code uses MLE; another R code uses Bayesian estimation with Stan.  Users are welcome to take the code and modify for your own use.  

Please cite this repository when appropriate. Thank you.

I presented this work with my coworker Srihari Jaganathan in the Annual PMSA confererence 2022.
I will present it again in the Annual INFORMS meeting 2022.
